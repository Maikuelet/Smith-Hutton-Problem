# Smith-Hutton-Problem
This repository contains a Matlab code developed for solving the convection-diffusion equation for the case of study of the Smith-Hutton Problem. 

The grid parameters, and numerical solver inputs are modifyed from the "InputData.m" file. A study of this problem is presented in the 
"Smith-Hutton-Problem.pdf" file.  In this study you can find a flowchart of the algorithm in the Section 2. The file that contains the 
core is "TransientConvectionDiffusion2D.m" , that executes the coefficient compute and iterates the discretized convection-diffusion 
equation over the domain calling the "Solver.m" file. 

For further studies you can check my thesis in the "Study for the computational resolution of conservation equations of mass, momentum
and energy" in the following link:
